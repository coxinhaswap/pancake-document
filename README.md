{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Network

CoxinhaSwap is a decentralized exchange on BSC at the moment, but more networks will be added soon.

### Low fees

CoxinhSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin. \
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!
Unlike competitors like sushi or CoxinhaSwap, all fees are transferred to the liquidity providers, which means users get more. \
To stay competitive in the long term, however, in the future we may charge a protocol fee as well. At the moment, CoxinhaSwap has the biggest benefits for liquidity providers.


### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app. \
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, CoxinhaSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.&#x20;
