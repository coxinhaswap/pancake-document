### Network

CoxinhaSwap is currently a decentralized exchange on BSC, however more networks will be added soon.

✅ Binance Smart Chain



### Low fees

#### Among competitors from other networks:
CoxinhSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin. \
But as mentioned, we will be part of Ethereum and other networks eventually, where the user will be able to choose which network to interact with.

#### Among competitors from the same network:
Trading fees are also lower than other decentralized exchanges, so this is a double win for you!
Unlike competitors like Sushi or PancakeSwap, all fees are transferred to the liquidity providers, which means users get more. \
However, in order to remain competitive in the long term, in the future we may also charge a protocol fee. \


| Protocol  | Total Fees |  Liquidity Providers Fee |  Protocol Fees |
| -----------------------| -----------------: | ------------: | ----------: |
| PancakeSwap       |                     0.25% |                     0.17% |    0.08% |
| CoxinhaSwap    |      0.25% |              0.25% |     0.00% |


At the moment, CoxinhaSwap has the biggest benefits for liquidity providers in BSC.

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app. \
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, CoxinhaSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.&#x20;
