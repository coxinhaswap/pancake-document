**Core** - proposals posted by the CoxinhaSwap team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the CoxinhaSwap community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The CoxinhaSwap team reviews every community vote and will often move any with strong community support up to the CORE proposal level.
