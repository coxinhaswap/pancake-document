## Intro

CoxinhaSwap logo downloads are at the bottom of this page, but please be sure to read these guidelines first.

> Although CoxinhaSwap distributes some of its technology under open-source licenses, **the CoxinhaSwap and COXI brands are not distributed under the same licenses.**

The following CoxinhaSwap "Brand Assets" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:

* The CoxinhaSwap and COXI logos, wordmark, icon
* The CoxinhaSwap name
* Other visual assets produced by CoxinhaSwap including but not limited to illustrations and 3d models

## What you may do

You may use CoxinhaSwap's Brand Assets when you are:

* üëå Referring to our products and services
* üëå Linking to our official site or products, such as "Trade our token on CoxinhaSwap"
* üëå Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have **official approval** by a qualified member of the CoxinhaSwap team

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at CoxinhaSwap@gmail.com

## What you may not do

While we strongly believe in and follow the open source ethos, **protecting the CoxinhaSwap brand is extremely important for our users' security,** so that users know what is a genuine product/endorsement and what isn't.

Here are a few examples of forbidden uses of our Brand Assets:

* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc.**&#x20;
  * For example, making an app called "CoxinhaSwap Engine" or "COXI Child" are not allowed.
  * Don't use the CoxinhaSwap logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.
  * Logos with a strong resemblence to the CoxinhaSwap Icon are also forbidden.
* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physcial products for sale, including but not limited to**
  * Merchandise ("Swag")
  * NFTs
  * Other products
*   ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement**

    For example, don't make a social media group called "CoxinhaSwap Italy" - this sounds official. "CoxinhaSwap Fans of Italy" may be permitted.
*   ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way**

    Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.

Use your common sense and creativity. If you want to make something relating to the CoxinhaSwap ecosystem, make it your own.

Have fun making a unique brand that's clearly yours -- if your product is strong, you won't need to rely on remixing CoxinhaSwap's brand.
