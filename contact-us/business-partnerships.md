## Listing on the Exchange <a href="#exchange" id="exchange"></a>

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on CoxinhaSwap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/CoxinhaSwap-exchange/CoxinhaSwap-pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

The top 100 list is generated according to the highest volume for a specific period of time. As for the Extended list, otherwise, other tokens chosen by CoxinhaSwap core team may also be added.

We don’t take applications for these lists. Users can still add your token manually by entering its contract address.

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

Please add your icon to Trust Wallet’s assets repo, which CoxinhaSwap references: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)

### Someone made a fake copy of my token! Can you block it?

Due to CoxinhaSwap’s nature as an AMM-based DEX, we’re not able to prevent the trading of any BEP-20 token. We recommend ensuring that your token contract is clearly visible and verifiable on your site, and educating your users about how to safely trade your token.

### People get an error when trading my token. What can I do?

Check our [Troubleshooting page](../help/troubleshooting.md) for a list of common errors on the exchange, and how to solve them.

Please don't try to contact us via this email for [customer support](customer-support.md), that's not what it's for and we won't respond: your best option for getting help with the product is via the [Telegram or Reddit community](telegram.md).
